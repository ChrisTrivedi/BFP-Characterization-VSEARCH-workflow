# BFP-Characterization-VSEARCH-workflow
A shell script used to process raw Illumina amplicon data through VSEARCH and QIIME 1.9.1

This shell script can be used as such or by executing commands individually. Personally, I like to go through each separately.

Please keep in mind this is more for my own consistency of data processing over different sample types. At this time I can offer no support on any issues.

NOTE: This script was used to process data for an upcoming publication by Trivedi et al. (in prep.)
